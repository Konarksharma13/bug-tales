# üêû Bug Tales

> **Turn your bugs into epic stories and clever fixes!**  
Bug Tales is a fun and elegant space-themed React app where you upload error screenshots and get back:
- A whimsical **story** describing your bug 
- A practical **solution** with copy-to-clipboard support

Instead of:  
_NullPointerException at line 42_
<br>
You get:  
*"In the Kingdom of Nullia, a brave knight ventured into line 42 only to find nothingness. The fix? Initialize thy variable before thou usest it."*  

Yes, debugging ‚Äî but with **vibes & smiles**.

## How It Works  
1. Upload a screenshot of your error.  
2. Pick a persona (wizard, pirate, bard, comedian, cosmic traveler,..).  
3. Hit **Launch a story**.  
4. Boom ‚Üí you get:  
   - A quirky short story of your bug.  
   - The real solution to fix it.

## Personas  
- Wizard: magical LOTR vibes  
- Pirate: exaggerated sea shanty  
- Bard: poetic rhymes  
- Cosmic Explorer: sci-fi wonder  
- Comedian: debugging with punchlines
